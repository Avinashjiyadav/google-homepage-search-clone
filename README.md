# Google Homepage & Search Clone - The Odin Project

Google homepage and search clone created with HTML, CSS and JS made as the first project into [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

**The input in the Google Home WORKS**. This input will transfer the string into the search page thanks to JS in the head of both the html pages and `action="search.html" method="GET"` in `<form>`.
